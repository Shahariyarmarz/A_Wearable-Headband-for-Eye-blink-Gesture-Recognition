For pushing a whole Folder to the repository follow the steps of command:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
git init
git add Data_visualization
git commit -m "Adding new Project"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Shahariyarmarz/Design-Development-of-a-Mechanomyography-Based-Wearable-Headset-for-Eye-blink-Gesture-Recognition
git push -u -f origin main (-f used for pushing folder with code---- remember you can not push any empty folder)




For committing changes in code :
---------------------------------------------------
First go to the code directory -------> cd Data_visualization
Then write command -------> git add -A
After that give a title for committing changes ------> git commit -m "title for changes in code"
At the end we have to check the branch(main/master) and remote origin (web address) added or not for pushing it to the main branch of repository --------->  git branch -M main  (if branch is already selected then we do not need select the branch)
---------> git remote add origin https://github.com/Shahariyarmarz/Design-Development-of-a-Mechanomyography-Based-Wearable-Headset-for-Eye-blink-Gesture-Recognition (if remote origin address is already added then we do not need to add remote origin also)
Finally, we can push it using command ------> git push




For creating local directory using gitbash:
----------------------------------------------------
go to the path using cd command, path address where you want to create directory ex: cd your_desire_path_address
use mkdir command  to create new directory ex: mkdir new_folder_name
